Many people may think that if you want to learn to program, you have to read a book or two and learn a programming language. For those just starting, it's fine. But you should know that to improve in this profession you need to read a lot of books. Programmers in our country are not as interested in coding as they are in reading and learning. And so their career ends in a short time.

One thing to think about is that after 5 years your salary will not be the same as the first year. If you still code like you did when you were a junior, what's the point of paying you more? You have to learn to design good and complex software, learn to manage teams, and much more. If you are busy coding after 3-4 years then this is a concern. And so the following books can help a lot to improve your skills. These books are widely known all over the world. If you don't understand one, read the other, keep reading, and read again and again. If you want to build a future, you have to do something, right?
